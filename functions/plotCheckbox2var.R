# this function is for the checkbox questions where more than one option can be selected. It plots two variables (e.g. combined with a demographic)
# in the ggplot section, there is a choice between plotting counts or percent stacked barplots; the plot of relative frequencies does not work yet
# the cleaned data files and key files are read in using the script readFilesCleanData.R
